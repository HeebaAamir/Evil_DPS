# Disaster Preparedness Simulator - User Manual
## Overview:
This is a console-based disaster survival simulation developed in C++. The software places the user in realistic emergency scenarios where quick thinking and correct decision-making are required to survive. The user must manage health, energy, and inventory while responding to time-limited choices. The purpose of this project is to prepare users for emergency situations by encouraging quick, efficient, and responsible decision-making under pressure.   
## Features:
1. Multiple disaster scenarios (Earthquake, Fire, Flood, Power Outage)    
2. Decision-based gameplay with time pressure      
3. Health and energy management system          
4. Inventory system with usable items           
5. Score calculation at the end of each game        
6. File handling for saving game history and player progress
7. Color coded display
## System Requirements:
•	Windows Operating System (as we have used windows compatible libraries e.g. windows.h)             
•	C++ Compiler           
•	Console or Terminal environment             
•	Visual Studio or any compatible C++ IDE              
## How to run the program: 
1. Use a C++ compatible IDE (Visual Studio) or compiler.
2. In the IDE, simply just debug the program and run it.
3. In a compiler, run the following command.
   #### g++ main.cpp-o Evil_DPS
4. This will make a executable file (Evil_DPS.exe). Run the executable file.
## How to use the simulation:
1. Run the program on the IDE.
2. An introductory message would be displayed after which user would be prompted to enter their name which will be used as a password for progress tracking.
3. A random disaster scenario would begin (It is done to mimic real world conditions where a person doesn't know what sort of unfortune would fall upon him).
4. Read each situation carefully and choose an option within the given time limit.
5. Each decision affects the user's health and energy.
6. Use inventory items when necessary to improve survival chances.
